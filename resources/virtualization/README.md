# ðŸªŸ Windows
I dont like the concept of kernel-level anti-cheat, so... I just use a cheesy workaround. The containing files pose as configuration for the Windows VM, with a initial installer script in case I need to reinstall it!

## ðŸš€ Setup
Creation of the Windows VM is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
./create_windows.sh
```
